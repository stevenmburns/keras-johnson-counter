# keras-johnson-counter

Experiments with very simple learning problems.

We want to learn a Johnson counter (a shift register with inverting feedback from the last register to the first).

We did this two ways:
* First, using Keras sequential models
* Second, using Keras function models were we constrained the network to look like a digitial circuit would.
